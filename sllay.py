# New Problems Now That We Have Solved These
# 1. Nomination Ceremony Relationships 
    # If you were nominated you're opinion of the HOH goes down by 2 
    # If you were not nominated you're opinion of the HOH goes up by 1
# 2. Veto Draw Ceremony
# At the veto ceremony the players draw out of a hat to choose who is competing in the veto competition
# Six players compete in every veto competition, 3 of those being the HOH, The 2 nominees, And three other randomly selected houseguests
# When randomly selecting the HOH draws out of the hat, then the two nominees. There is one chip in the bag which contains something called Houseguests Choice
# When Houseguests Choice is chosen the player who drew it picks the person who they have the highest relationship with to compete in the challenge
# When someone picks using Houseguests Choice the chosen player gets +1 relationship with the person who chose them
# Note (There is only one Houseguest Choice in the bag so it can only be selected once)
# 3. Veto Competition
# Same as the HOH where it totals all players comp abilities playing the veto and then picks a number between the range and associates that number with a winner. 
# This means we should probably at the Veto Draw ceremony define all the players in the competition within a list
